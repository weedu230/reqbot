    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the app in development mode, you need to run both the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows concurrently.

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the web application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit flows:**
    In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the Genkit development server:
    ```sh
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This allows the Next.js app to communicate with your AI flows. The Genkit UI will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
